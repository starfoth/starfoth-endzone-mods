Mechanics
 Global Limit Exceptions: Some buildings will come with exceptions to the global limit and will seek to continue to produce equipment to supply certain logistic buildings. IE any tool maker or tailor connected to a general goods store will produce extra tools and clothes to fill it up if there are no clothes or tools in range of the general goods store and it is not full.
 Kitchen Changes: Kitchens will be moved to a 1 utensil research and be vastly less efficient (10 raw food + 10 water for 20 cakes instead of 100)
 Research additions: All basic logistic  buildings above will be seperated into different research  slots
 Books: The attractiveness of the scriptorium is affected by its collection of books. (Very large range) Books can be bought from a special trader (that also sells research points, utensils, seeds, and animals) but must be printed at each scriptorium. The printing can be set to run automatically and produces copies of any books you have collected. Requires a large amount of wood and maybe an ink-related growable resource.
